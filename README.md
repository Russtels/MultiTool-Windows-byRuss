### ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started

1.  **Configure:** Edit the `apps.json` file to add the applications you want, along with their download URLs and silent installation arguments.
2.  **Compile:** Build the project using Visual Studio.
3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled `.exe` as an administrator for the best results.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

The application reads the `apps.json` file to populate a list of available software. When you select an application to install, the tool:

1.  Checks if the installer file already exists in the `Downloads` folder.
2.  If not, it downloads the file using the specified `DownloadUrl`.
3.  Executes the installer with the silent arguments (`SilentArgs`) to automate the installation process without user intervention.
